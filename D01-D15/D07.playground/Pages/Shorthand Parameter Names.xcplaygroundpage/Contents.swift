// we can call travel() like this
travel { (place: String) -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// however, Swift knows the parameter to that closure must be a string, so we can remove it:
travel { place -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// it also knows the closure must return a string, so we can remove that:
travel { place in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// as the closure only has one line of code that must be the one that returns the value, so Swift lets us remove the return keyword too:
travel { place in
    "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

// Rather than writing place in we can let Swift provide automatic names for the closureâ€™s parameters. These are named with a dollar sign, then a number counting from 0.
travel {
    "I'm going to \($0) in my car"
}
